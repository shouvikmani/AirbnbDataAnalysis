It's centrally located close to transportation (subway railroad taxis) and the area is filled with bars and restaurants.  --- A ONE FLOOR walk-up  I'm listing this place as a "private room" for legal purposes but I'll be out of your hair 100% of the time and there is a 99.9% chance you will not see me at all.  You will have the studio - all of it - to yourself. There is a 99.9% chance you will not see me at all.  I usually host while I'm out of town so it's very likely I won't be around - you will have your privacy! I do respond to messages texts and calls when needed.  The listing is literally steps away from Grand Central Station with its trains and subway lines. There are plenty of taxis and ridesharing options all around. I can recommend and usually provide discount codes for transportation from NY airports.  The building may not look great from the outside but the apartment is clean and fresh and the photos are recent (last updated in September 2016).

I have lots of books you can read in the apartment so feel free to ask!  You can use the laundry facility downstairs but you have to pay for and do your own laundry. I have a large kitchen with a chemex for coffee (happy to leave instructions) and you are welcome to use any of my dishes as long as you return them safely and load the dishwasher when you're done! Eating nook for everyone too!  I will be pretty hands off and most likely in and out the entire time other than check-in and check-out. I will not be cleaning your towels for you if it's a shorter stay so you're responsible for your own laundry if you need that done. I also have a few extra towels I can provide and if it's a longer stay I'm happy to help out with laundry. That said there's a laundry facility in our building! :) Hooray! I have a cat and a puppy and stay in the other room with us most of the time.  We are right next door to the A express train 25 minutes from mid-town (Central Park). Just around the corner are several coffee shops thai food and several wonderful restaurants. The Cloisters Museum is a few blocks away with the best NYC hiking you can find. Inwood Hill Park is a few blocks away as well. Lots of beautiful nature nearby! :)  Take the A train! It's express and super fast. Also close the 1 local train if that's needed ( a few blocks). I use (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps to get to and from any airports. Buses and trains are the least expensive option cabs are great if you have some money to spend!  Please leave the place as clean as you found it. Don't worry about washing your blankets or towels at the end—I can do that!

In most of Brooklyn there are many small shops and restaurants but in my neighborhood there are more large businesses like IKEA Costco Lowes and Home Depot. Many of Brooklyn's products are created in my neighborhood. So directly around me there are a few great options when it comes to food and coffee but not many.

No lavish lobby or doorman here ;) This is a 3 story walk-up ( I view this as a perk as it is a built in glut and quad work out ;) ) This neighborhood and my building are very culturally diverse which I view as a Perk--wafting aromas of West Indian fare and very occasionally or rarely rather lively music. The noise level in Brooklyn is like that of the country compared to Manhattan but as with the music occasionally the courtyard will be a meeting place for families. Luckily my bedroom is on the other side of the building and is in an enclave very quiet for 90% of the time.

The neighborhood is changing all of the time and there is quite a bit of renovation happening with businesses and apartment buildings. We are located in the Bronx which means that you are going to see a diverse population in this neighborhood. We enjoy the culture of this neighborhood and have always felt comfortable and safe here but we've lived in the city for 10 years now in three different neighborhoods and have come to love the edginess of what the Bronx represents. You have very easy access to shops the grocery store post office and restaurants and most importantly the SUBWAY - all within walking distance.  We are close to: Montefiore Medical Center - Hutchinson Campus (1.1 miles) Montefiore Medical Center - Moses Division (4.5 miles) Jacobe Medical Center (1.9 miles) Mercy College (0.9 miles) Albert Einstein Hospital (1.4 miles) Pelham Bay Park (0.5 miles) & Orchard Beach (2.5 miles) New York Botanical Gardens (4.2 miles) Bronx Zoo (3.7 miles)  Getting around is very easy! Everything you need is within walking distance! Two blocks from the 6 train subway which is 40 minute ride to Grand Central station (midtown Manhattan). If you are traveling to downtown Manhattan the ride is about 1 hour. Travel travels late at night can be longer due to reduced train service.   If you have a car there is street parking that's where we park our car. Make sure that you read the parking signs as there are different regulations depending on where you park. There are also lots of buses at the Pelham Bay station about a 7 minute walk that you can use to travel across the Bronx.

Among the bold-faced names currently calling the area home are Jay-Z and Beyoncé Gwyneth Paltrow and Taylor Swift. Robert De Niro has famously done much to encourage TriBeCa's vitality. Plenty of unfamous folks live here too thanks to excellent public schools lovely parks and superb views of the Hudson River. Indeed the neighborhood has a family-friendly atmosphere you might not expect from the cast-iron buildings and cobblestone streets which speak to the area's industrial past or from its present reputation for exciting dining and nightlife. Former warehouses have become lofts galleries and performance spaces and in the evening the streets thrum with people out for a drink at one of the many lounges looking to hear a song or see a play or trying to get a table at one of the neighborhood's many extraordinary restaurants.

I live here and am usually very available.  Bushwick is one of the best neighborhoods in New York and I'd encourage you to take advantage of being here! It's somewhat rugged in appearance but that is part of what started drawing artists out here in the 2004-2008 period as Williamsburg became more expensive after the Bloomberg-era rezoning of the waterfront.   There are amazing restaurants and bars as well as coffee shops stores and music venues that I have listed in the Guidebook. Williamsburg is also very close by on the J or L -- you can get there in 10 minutes.  I understand of course that many people come here to go to Manhattan and the J/M/Z on Broadway can take you to Manhattan in as little as 15 minutes (during rush hour).  The closest subway station is the Myrtle-Broadway JMZ which takes you to JFK Airport in 1 hour and downtown Manhattan in as little as 20 minutes (at rush hour).  The L train is close by as well at Morgan Avenue.   If you wish to drive there are several Quik Park lots in the area (you can search on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)) but you can usually find free parking on the street.

There are several great Mexican restaurants in the area and a really great West African restaurant near the subway as well serval other food options.

It's a 5-8 minute walk to Manhattan (the dropping off point is 128th Street in historic Harlem.)  There is a bus across the street that will have you in Manhattan in less than 3.  Museum mile is less than 20 minutes away by subway…this is total commuting time including the walk to and from the subway.   •It's 15-20 minutes to Grand Central •18-25 to Union Square

We've had previous guests who don't clean up after themselves in the kitchen and it's become an issue. Thank you for bearing with us about this rule.

Located in the heart of the East Village arguably the most fashionable and happening neighborhood in the city for 20 and 30 somethings. Walk to more bars and restaurants than you will need in a lifetime. LGBTQIA safe space open to hosting couples of all stripes including straight ones.  The apartment is a two bedroom one bathroom apartment. One bedroom is yours exclusively and the bathroom is shared with me. The room itself is small yet bright and airy with a large closet given the size of the room. The room is high enough that it overcomes the height of the surrounding buildings and has a view you can see the Empire State Building from your room.  The living area and kitchen are not particularly large  it is a prewar two-bedroom apartment  but the kitchen has a dishwasher. Feel free to use my Nespresso machine if you need a quick cappuccino in the morning or my kettle for tea. I recommend you have your morning coffee on the roof deck the view is spectacular. The roof deck itself has a spectacular view from the World Trade Center to the Chrysler building. It is a great place to have a few beers or a glass of champagne after a day walking around the city. Laundry is available inside the building and costs extra there is also a wash and fold service I can recommend. If you stay for more than two weeks the housekeeper will come and clean the apartment at least every two weeks. I will typically take out the kitchen trash daily.  As my guest you'll be able to access and use the kitchen the roof deck where you can eat and relax and of course your bedroom where you can watch TV.  The only place I request you not go is my bedroom.  However you can knock if you need me. I will not go into your room without permission while you are here and expect the same courtesy.  I live in the apartment full time. I enjoy meeting my guests if time permits. I typically like to go for a few drinks with my guests on the first night just to get to know you.  I can always recommend a restaurant  a place to go out  or an activity for the day.  Occasionally I work from home and am available to chat all day  but for the most part during the week I will be at work.  Feel free to approach me  I generally err on the side of giving you too much privacy.  I like to get to know guests but I'm very careful not to seem intrusive.   I accept people of all races gender identities sexual orientations in my home. I am not religious and would be deeply offended if someone tried to proselytize to me in my own home.  The East Village is where young college graduates go to live after attending Ivy League schools.  The best way to describe it is young posh and trendy.  One of my French friends describes it as "bourgeois Bobo".  It is also a very gay neighborhood.  The East Village has the largest concentration of gay bars in any place other than Hells Kitchen and they attract a younger more local crowd.  There are hundreds of excellent restaurants and dozens of bars within a ten-minute walk of the apartment.  The subway is a five-minute walk away.  I tend to walk most places.  In this neighborhood you could probably get away with never using transit or cabs.  The closest subways are the first Avenue L train or the Astor Place six train.   If you're willing to walk a few blocks more you can get to Union Square which is the terminus for most of the trains in the city.  To get to work every morning I generally walk to Union Square and catch the express train to Wall Street.  You can hail a cab just by walking outside  there are always plenty of them.  This apartment is a fifth-floor walk-up  there are lots of steep stairs involved. If I am home I can help you with your bag. Just remember lots of stairs are good for having a shapely behind.
40.80091179994301,-73.91449059495062,71,5.0,11,1.0,1,Port Morris,1,30,A Suite in a large studio space for one person or a couple with a separate entry.  This sunny Studio is an open floor apartment on the private second floor. Composed of a big private bedroom and bathroom (tub & shower) as well as a living room with a sofa & desk to work or lounge (separated by sliding doors from the bedroom). 4 windows and Sky Views.   A Shared kitchen is on the first floor. Convenient to Manhattan: 7 minute walk to subway. 40 minutes to Grand Central. I do it every day.  You have your own floor loft like in this townhouse for yourself which is on the top floor -1st floor) with views from 4 huge windows of which give  on the sky and Manhattan and two onto a garden. Perfect for one person or a couple. 6 minute walk to the 6 subway.   The house is full of light. Parking in front 6 mins walk to Subway 6 (30 mins from 42nd street). A great big garden with lawn and table to eat out. Calm and Clean. View on Manhattan.  It is unique. It is super calm. It'a gem and a find as it is so very close to Manhattan. if you like to come home at night or wake up in the morning with no noise...total calm and greenery in your garden with a back yard and a super reasonable price for a real house with art everywhere and super spacious this is a home.  You have to overcome all your fears of the Bronx! This is the Southern Eastern tip of the Bronx one minute from the East river. It is mostly warehouses and storage here. You can walk to Randall's island form here where the Frieze fair was.  I have been living here 4 years I am a woman and I have never been scared nor mugged. I live here with my 2 sons. I work from home so I have a big office with fast internet and a big desk on the second floor. The bedrooms have a big double bed Queen size with a nice bathroom next to them. The house is full of books tidily organized in bookcases and full of nice european decor. A key to a house and all its amenities: wireless internet/ 2 independent floors/ 2 big bedrooms/ one big office-studio/air conditioning/washer/dryer/washing machine/. Back yard with Garden and Grass and flowers and a table for 5 people and a barbecue. Outside free parking in the street.  I will not have much interaction with the guests as I will be away. But I have access to my e mail and phone or SMS if necessary. So you feel in the country even though you are 20 minutes from the big city of New York by the regular Metro. I go to NY every day.  Despite the Bronx name which scares many people it is very safe in this neighborhood in the South Bronx called Port Morris because it is very far from the low income housing where the problems do exist. Here it is quite secluded and off the radar so it is safe. But I will be frank there is nothing to do here: no restaurants no dry cleaning no deli's. All that is in Manhattan when you reach 125th street and under. I go there every day or every other day. I am exaggerating a bit there are 2 delis at the subway station Cypress with dry cleaners. But you have to walk a bit. Some of my older New york friends compare this neighborhood to the way SOHO or Tribeca use to be. It is industrial meaning it is big warehouses for storage in nice brick buildings. There are big studios and loft spaces around. Very few townhouses. This house is on a street where there are about 20 townhouses.  Very easy to get around. A 7 minute walk to the 6 Line subway at Cypress Avenue.  3 stops only from the express 4 and 5 lines at 125th street (15 minutes). 4 stops to 86th street (18 minutes). 5 stops to 59 th street (21 minutes). 6 stops to 42 nd Street Grand Central (26minutes). 7 stops to 14th street Union Square (32 minutes).  There is also a bus (the BX 33)  at the corner of the street if you do not like to walk which drops you off in front of the  Cypress Avenue subway. I take it at night when I am tired. Runs every 15 minutes. 15 minutes from 125 th street Metro North for escapades to the Hudson by train.  It is like being in the country 20 minutes from Manhattan in a neighborhood that is totally unknown called Port Morris in the most Southern and Eastern tipi of The Bronx. It is next to the East River so the air is always nice. Probably better for persons who are a bit of a 'pioneer spirit'.   During the summer of 2014 I  am looking ideally for guests who will preferably rent for one month in July 2014).   It is a totally renovated townhouse on 2 floors which feels very much like a home.  For one or two you will have access to the 2nd floor which is a big space.  A private living room and office with a sofa  and a huge desk in one huge room and a private separate bedroom with one big bed bedroom ( a king bed) and a private bathroom.  You have access to a shared kitchen with all the utensils you will need. 4 huge windows on wither side of the loft like space. You have access to the garden in the back.  The calm great sky beautiful brick industrial buildings and the fact I am so close to Manhattan with the 6 trains always working and have access to the 4/5 express trains. }It is an unusually unknown part of the city as it is industrial there are very few townhouses.. so this is a find. I have lived here 5 years and I can tell you it is safe but unexpected like Soho or Tribecca used to be before they were gentrified without the drug drama… This is a place where you need to like silence calm when you get back home as there are no bars restaurants that near…but despite the reputation of The Bronx it is very safe!  The 6 train in only 6 minutes away. We are 3 stations from the 4/5 express lines. So you are on 86th street in 25 minutes door to door. Union Square in 40 minutes door to door.  Sunny and luminous Townhouse close to Manhattan with garden and safe charm unexpected european fell with books. Artist owned. 6 minute walk to 6 train 15 minutes to 125th street harlem 30" to 42nd train 40 "to Union Square. A find.

Lower Manhattan is the home of the financial district (FiDi) of Manhattan located at the southern tip of the island with the Hudson River on the west the East River on the east New York Harbor to the south and Chambers Street on the north. It is one of the two largest business districts in New York City - the other being Midtown Manhattan - and is the historical core of the modern city; a fact reflected in the convoluted street pattern compared to the regular streets and avenues found uptown. Lower Manhattan is home to some of New York's most famous and evocative landmarks: Wall Street the Brooklyn Bridge as well as the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island and Ellis Island in the harbor both accessed by ferry boat from the financial district.  By subway  Most of the city's subway lines have stops in lower Manhattan either World Trade Center or the Fulton Center stop making it one of the best ways to get to the district. There are few express stations in the area so most trains will stop at every station in this neighborhood. Though many city bus lines serve the area traffic is often slow on the winding streets.  The 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lines connect the district to Uptown and the Bronx with the 2 3 and 4 also running to Brooklyn under the East River (along with the 5 during rush hours). The A and C lines run Uptown and east out to Brooklyn with the A continuing to the JFK Airport area. The E runs alongside the A and C lines to Midtown where it breaks off and runs out to Queens. The R heads north to Midtown Queens and east to Brooklyn. Finally the J and Z lines head northeast to Brooklyn and Queens but be aware that Broad St and the J/Z section of Fulton St are closed on weekends.  Additionally PATH subway trains connect the World Trade Center site to New Jersey. There are two lines: one to Newark and one to Hoboken both stop in Jersey City the latter returns north and back across the Hudson to Manhattan and terminates in the West Village. The PATH costs $1.75 per ride and accept MetroCard for payment.  There is a free circular bus around Lower Manhattan called the Downtown Connection.  Garage: 1.

The ferry is absolutely free and is popular for tourists since the route offers excellent views of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. The ferry runs 24 hours a day usually running at 30 minute intervals with more running during rush hours and fewer running at very late hours. NY Waterway operates ferry services from the World Financial Center ferry terminal and the Pier 11/Wall St. ferry terminal to several points in New Jersey along the Hudson River including in Hoboken and Weehawken. Fares vary by route.

Come have an amazing time while maintaining a budget for our many attractions this beautiful city has to offer.  Woodside is a working- and middle-class residential and commercial neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth on the north by Astoria on the west by Sunnyside and on the east by Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet while other parts especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue are more urban. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community Board 1 and Queens Community Board 2.[2]  In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However with large-scale residential development in the 1860s Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s many Asian American families moved into the area with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.  Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai Filipino and South American eateries.  NEAR BY TRANSPORTATION  Subways and Commuter Rail 7 at Fisk Av-69th St 0.3 miles  LIRR at Woodside 0.3 miles  MR at 65th St 0.4 miles  EFMR7 at Roosevelt Av-Jackson Hts 0.4 mile  Quick commute to NYC and/or JFk and LGA Airport.

Come have an amazing time while maintaining a budget for our many attractions this beautiful city has to offer.  Woodside is a working- and middle-class residential and commercial neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth on the north by Astoria on the west by Sunnyside and on the east by Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet while other parts especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue are more urban. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community Board 1 and Queens Community Board 2.[2]  In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However with large-scale residential development in the 1860s Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s many Asian American families moved into the area with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.  Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai Filipino and South American eateries.  NEAR BY TRANSPORTATION  Subways and Commuter Rail 7 at Fisk Av-69th St 0.3 miles  LIRR at Woodside 0.3 miles  MR at 65th St 0.4 miles  EFMR7 at Roosevelt Av-Jackson Hts 0.4 mile  Quick commute to NYC and/or JFk and LGA Airport.

Come have an amazing time while maintaining a budget for our many attractions this beautiful city has to offer.  Woodside is a working- and middle-class residential and commercial neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth on the north by Astoria on the west by Sunnyside and on the east by Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet while other parts especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue are more urban. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community Board 1 and Queens Community Board 2.[2]  In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However with large-scale residential development in the 1860s Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s many Asian American families moved into the area with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.  Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai Filipino and South American eateries.  NEAR BY TRANSPORTATION  Subways and Commuter Rail 7 at Fisk Av-69th St 0.3 miles  LIRR at Woodside 0.3 miles  MR at 65th St 0.4 miles  EFMR7 at Roosevelt Av-Jackson Hts 0.4 mile  Quick commute to NYC and/or JFk and LGA Airport.

Come have an amazing time while maintaining a budget for our many attractions this beautiful city has to offer.  Woodside is a working- and middle-class residential and commercial neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth on the north by Astoria on the west by Sunnyside and on the east by Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet while other parts especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue are more urban. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community Board 1 and Queens Community Board 2.[2]  In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However with large-scale residential development in the 1860s Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s many Asian American families moved into the area with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.  Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai Filipino and South American eateries.  NEAR BY TRANSPORTATION  Subways and Commuter Rail 7 at Fisk Av-69th St 0.3 miles  LIRR at Woodside 0.3 miles  MR at 65th St 0.4 miles  EFMR7 at Roosevelt Av-Jackson Hts 0.4 mile  Quick commute to NYC and/or JFk and LGA Airport.

Also we are raising an infant. We think his presence adds a level of serenity and peace to our space. His room is on the other end of the apartment off the front bedroom.

Come have an amazing time while maintaining a budget for our many attractions this beautiful city has to offer.  Woodside is a working- and middle-class residential and commercial neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth on the north by Astoria on the west by Sunnyside and on the east by Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet while other parts especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue are more urban. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community Board 1 and Queens Community Board 2.[2]  In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However with large-scale residential development in the 1860s Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s many Asian American families moved into the area with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.  Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai Filipino and South American eateries.  NEAR BY TRANSPORTATION  Subways and Commuter Rail 7 at Fisk Av-69th St 0.3 miles  LIRR at Woodside 0.3 miles  MR at 65th St 0.4 miles  EFMR7 at Roosevelt Av-Jackson Hts 0.4 mile  Quick commute to NYC and/or JFk and LGA Airport.
